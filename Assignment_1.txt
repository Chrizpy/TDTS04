3) What is the IP address of your computer? Of the gaia.cs.umass.edu server?
    128.119.245.12 
    Destination for packet 10

4) What is the status code returned from the server to your browser?
    200
    [Hypertext Transfer Protocol]->[Get]->[Expert Info]->[Status code] at packet 12

5) When was the HTML file that you are retrieving last modified at the server?
    Tue, 23 Sep 2003 05:29:00 GMT
    [Hypertext Transfer Protocol]->[Get]->[Last Modified] at packet 12

6) How many bytes of content are being returned to your browser?
    73 bytes 
    [Hypertext Transfer Protocol]->[Get]->[Content-Length] at packet 12

7) By inspecting the raw data in the packet content pane, do you see any http headers within the data that are not displayed in the packet-listing window? If so, name one.
    No?

8) Inspect the contents of the first HTTP GET request from your browser to the server. Do you see an “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE” line in the HTTP GET?
    No, but it exists in the next GET request
9)  Inspect the contents of the server response. Did the server explicitly return the contents of the file? How can you tell?
    Yes the server returned the contents. You can tell because the html data is in the content and status code is 200
10) Now inspect the contents of the second HTTP GET request from your browser to the server. Do you see an “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:” line in the HTTP GET? If so, what information follows the “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:” header?
    Yes. If-Modified-Since: Tue, 23 Sep 2003 05:35:00 GMT

11) What is the HTTP status code and phrase returned from the server in response to this second HTTP GET? Did the server explicitly return the contents of the file? Explain.
    304 : Not Modified. No content was return in the second response. Because the html file was not been changed since the last HTTP GET request there was not need for the server to send the html file again.
    This saves bandwidth?

12) How many HTTP GET request messages did your browser send? Which packet number in the trace contains the GET message for the Bill or Rights?
    1 packet number 8
13) Which packet number in the trace contains the status code and phrase associated with the response to the HTTP GET request? What is the status code and phrase in the response?
    Packet number 14 with status code 200 and response phrase: OK
14) How many data-containing TCP segments were needed to carry the single HTTP response and the text of the Bill of Rights?
    9
15) Is there any HTTP header information in the transmitted data associated with TCP segmentation? For this question you may want to think about at what layer each protocol operates, and how the protocols at the different layers interoperate.
    Yes. The TCP segments most contain the HTTP header information.

16) How many HTTP GET request messages were sent by your browser? To which Internet addresses were these GET requests sent?
