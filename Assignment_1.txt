-- TASK A --

1) Is your browser running HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1? What version of HTTP is the server running?
    Browser is running version 1.1 and the server is also running 1.1
    Is found at [Hypertext Transfer Protocol]->[Get]->[Expert Info]->[Request/Response Version] in packets 10 and 12.

2) What languages (if any) does your browser indicate that it can accept to the server? In the captured session, what other information (if any) does the browser provide the server with regarding the user/browser?
	English-US at [Hypertext Transfer Protocol]->[Get]->[Accept-Language]

    Browser version     [User-Agent]       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.0.2) Gecko/20021120 Netscape/7.01
    Accepted file types [Accept]           text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,video/x-mng,image/png,image/jpeg,image/gif;q=0.2,text/css,*/*;q=0.1
    Encoding            [Accept-Encoding]  gzip, deflate, compress;q=0.9
    Character set       [Accept-Charset]   Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1, utf-8;q=0.66, *;q=0.66

3) What is the IP address of your computer? Of the gaia.cs.umass.edu server?
    128.119.245.12 
    Destination for packet 10

4) What is the status code returned from the server to your browser?
    200
    [Hypertext Transfer Protocol]->[Get]->[Expert Info]->[Status code] at packet 12

5) When was the HTML file that you are retrieving last modified at the server?
    Tue, 23 Sep 2003 05:29:00 GMT
    [Hypertext Transfer Protocol]->[Get]->[Last Modified] at packet 12

6) How many bytes of content are being returned to your browser?
    73 bytes 
    [Hypertext Transfer Protocol]->[Get]->[Content-Length] at packet 12

7) By inspecting the raw data in the packet content pane, do you see any http headers within the data that are not displayed in the packet-listing window? If so, name one.
    No? Can't find any more HTTP headers in the raw data.

Discussion:

A few different HTTP versions can be spotted throughout the internet. The one that greeted us in this lab is version 1.1 which came out in 1997, since then 2.0 was introduced in 2015 and the latest one 3.0 which was introduced last year of 2018. A lot of neat information can be found in the HTTP packet, namely what sort of languages are being seeked by the browser, how big it is (bytes) and so on.

-- TASK B --

8) Inspect the contents of the first HTTP GET request from your browser to the server. Do you see an “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE” line in the HTTP GET?
    No, but it exists in the next GET request
9)  Inspect the contents of the server response. Did the server explicitly return the contents of the file? How can you tell?
    Yes the server returned the contents. You can tell because the html data is in the content and status code is 200
10) Now inspect the contents of the second HTTP GET request from your browser to the server. Do you see an “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:” line in the HTTP GET? If so, what information follows the “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:” header?
    Yes. If-Modified-Since: Tue, 23 Sep 2003 05:35:00 GMT

11) What is the HTTP status code and phrase returned from the server in response to this second HTTP GET? Did the server explicitly return the contents of the file? Explain.
    304 : Not Modified. No content was return in the second response. Because the html file was not been changed since the last HTTP GET request there was not need for the server to send the html file again.
    
Discussion:

HTTP seems to know with the help of "IF-MODIFIED-SINCE" (status code 304) if the file has been modified since the last time it was downloaded, the protocol will not issue a download for the requested file if so is the case. This can save bandwidth for the user and the server since the file won't have to be downloaded again.

-- TASK C --

12) How many HTTP GET request messages did your browser send? Which packet number in the trace contains the GET message for the Bill or Rights?
    1 packet number 8
13) Which packet number in the trace contains the status code and phrase associated with the response to the HTTP GET request? What is the status code and phrase in the response?
    Packet number 14 with status code 200 and response phrase: OK
14) How many data-containing TCP segments were needed to carry the single HTTP response and the text of the Bill of Rights?
    Three separate TCP segments and one that contains the last bit of data and the HTTP response.
15) Is there any HTTP header information in the transmitted data associated with TCP segmentation? For this question you may want to think about at what layer each protocol operates, and how the protocols at the different layers interoperate.
    Yes, but not all TCP packets will include HTTP data. The last TCP segment contain the HTTP header information.

Discussion:

All HTTP data WILL be encapsuled into a TCP packet but all TCP packets will not contain HTTP data because of connection establishment amongst other things that TCP will enforce. In wireshark, the tag with [TCP segment of a reassambled PDU] reveals that the packet holds user data or some kind of file.
 
-- TASK D --

16) How many HTTP GET request messages were sent by your browser? To which Internet addresses were these GET requests sent?
	3 were sent from our broswer to three different addresses: 128.119.245.12, 165.193.123.218, 134.241.6.82
17) Can you tell whether your browser downloaded the two images serially, or whether they were downloaded from the two web sites in parallel? Explain.
	It was downloaded in parallell. The HTML was downloaded first, after that the browser knew what objects to fetch
	and can do that in parallell.
	
Discussion:

The HTML document can contain object which is fetched elsewhere, when the requested HTML has objects like images that are sourced elsewhere, another GET request will be issued for these by the browser and these can run in parallell if there are more than one objects to be fetched.

-- TASK E --

18) What is the server’s response (status code and phrase) in response to the initial HTTP GET message from your browser?
	401 Authorization Required
19) When your browser sends the HTTP GET message for the second time, what new field is included in the HTTP GET message?
	The field Authorization is added.
20) What does the "Connection: close" and "Connection: keep-alive" header field imply in HTTP protocol? When should one be used over the other?
	Connection: keep-alive/close can be both specified by the server or client whether or not the connection should still 	      remain open for requests, the reason to keep the connection open is to avoid unnecessary handshakes again to establish 	     the connection again.
